-So how about the second time?

-I believe it was a thursday, might have been sunny?

Well I was in a good mood that day and on my way to meet a client but sadly a bit late as usual.

Ran down the subway to make up some time, only needing to go one or perhaps two stops. Seldomly use it now adays. I preferr walking.

Who writes nike on a train? or is it mike? So much graffiti with unclear messages.

I entered the second cart and there she stood, by the other door grasping the handle. New day new scarf, blue this time but I would recognize that purple hair anywere.


missed stop
probably lost a client

The day started as every other day. I took my laptop case and headed to my local coffee shop, ordered by triple expresso, found my seat and looked up the latest bugs on GitHub.

This morning I had some bugs related to the data flow. Some javascript event triggered another screen to reload even though no data was changed or no buttons were pressed. And this happened for every reload, it took me the good part of the morning to localize it and when I finally found it. Well, let's say that trivial don't even cover it. I was a bit embarrassed but then again the good part of freelancing is that you can commit your code when you're good and done and no one will berate you for your simple mistakes.

I took this opportunity to sit back and lift my gaze to the rest of the shop. It's early so only the regulars have so far appeared. It's then I notice her. She stands with her back to me, red scarf, blue shirt, and jeans talking to the barista. I've not seen her before here. I guess she is as the rest of us a freelancer that wanted to change venue after another caf√© got crowded.

She swipes her phone to pay and turns around when our eyes meet the world stops.

I know it's a cliche that when you see someone special the world around you stops, but in this case not just the world she froze as well. Maybe I was glaring and made her uncomfortable so I looked down at my code for a while and tried to concentrate on my work, a minute later when I looked up again she still stared at me.

But she didn't move, not even a muscle. Something felt wrong so I took in the surroundings and realized that the barista was still standing bent behind the counter, and I did not hear the taps on keyboards, clinking of spoons or light chatter. The shop was dead silent.

Everything was still. Amazing, I got to my feet and went to the counter. Lifted a spoon and let it drop. And gravity still worked so it fell to the ground with a loud clinking. 

I lightly tapped her shoulder and in an instance, she was gone. 

- Do you want something more, George? The barista asked.

I turned astonished in a daze, what did he say?

- No, it's okay, did you see her?
- Yes, she ran out screaming.

That was the first time it happened.
